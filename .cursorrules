# AI Rules for E-Learning Project

## Project Context
We are building an E-Learning platform from scratch using a modern tech stack (Laravel, Inertia.js, React, Tailwind CSS). 

The AI must act as a precise, cautious, and helpful assistant. It must perform development work carefully, follow instructions exactly, and avoid making assumptions or implementing unrequested changes.

---

## Main Rules
1. **Read Before Coding**: Always read the existing project structure, styles, and code patterns before making any changes.
2. **Strict Scope**: Do not touch unrelated files or make changes outside the requested scope.
3. **No Unrequested Features**: Never add features, buttons, routes, styles, or logic that were not explicitly requested.
4. **Code Preservation**: Do not remove existing code, configurations, or features unless the task specifically requires it.
5. **Reuse & Extend**: Always reuse existing components, layouts, hooks, utilities, and services. Do not create duplicates.
6. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Keep code clean, simple, readable, and maintainable. Avoid over-engineering or adding redundant abstractions.
7. **No Unnecessary Refactoring**: Do not refactor or rewrite the whole project/file when only a minor modification is needed.
8. **Consistent Naming**: Keep naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case, snake_case) aligned with the existing codebase.
9. **Explain Changes**: Provide a clear explanation of exactly what was modified, added, or removed after completing the task.

## Before Coding Checklists
Before writing or editing code, verify:
* [ ] **Folder Structure**: Where should this code live?
* [ ] **Existing Components**: Is there a component we can reuse?
* [ ] **Routes/Pages**: Are the routes already defined or generated?
* [ ] **API Structure**: What endpoint design is already in place?
* [ ] **Database/Models**: What tables and relationships already exist?
* [ ] **Styles**: Are we utilizing the Tailwind/CSS theme variables correctly?
* [ ] **Authentication/Authorization**: What role/permission restrictions apply?

---

## Task Behavior Protocol
Every user prompt must be treated as a specific task. Responses must adhere to this structure:

### 1. Task
Explain the requested task in simple, clear terms to confirm understanding.

### 2. Files to Check
List the files and directories that should be reviewed before coding.

### 3. Plan
Outline a short, step-by-step implementation plan before making modifications.

### 4. Changes
Apply only the requested edits within the target files.

### 5. Result
Detail what changes were made, what files were updated, and highlight any important testing notes.

## Coding Limits & Restrictions
The AI **must not**:
* Add new pages or views unless requested.
* Add new user roles or permissions unless requested.
* Add new database tables or columns unless requested.
* Change the UI design or styling system unless requested.
* Change authentication flow or permission logic unless requested.
* Rename files or folders unless requested.
* Refactor unrelated files.
* Install npm packages or composer dependencies without approval.

---

## Component Rules (UI Development)
* **Folder Structure & Routing**: Pages and views must be structured using `index` files (e.g., `index.jsx`), which can have a `partials/` folder nested directly alongside them for local subcomponents. Dynamic routes must use `id` for naming (e.g., `[id]`).
* **Default to Reuse**: Look in `resources/js/components/` and `resources/js/components/ui/` for existing solutions first.
* **Single Responsibility**: Keep new components focused on a single job.
* **Keep Logic Simple**: Write straightforward React state and effect logic. Do not add complex state managers unless approved.
* **No Duplication**: Do not create similar UI components with minor differences. Parameterize/extend existing ones instead.
* **Localization**: Use the `TransText` component for rendering dynamic text based on the user's language stored in `localStorage`. The default language must be English (`'en'`).

---

## Backend & API Rules
* **Use Existing Architecture**: Integrate with existing controllers, requests, resources, and services.
* **Clean Validation**: Write clear request validation rules for all incoming data.
* **Sensitive Data Protection**: Never expose passwords, secret keys, or internal identifiers in API responses.
* **Strict Permissions**: Enforce authorization checks (policies, gates, middlewares) on all backend actions.
* **Database Stability**: Do not alter database structures or migrations unless explicitly instructed.

---

## Final Response Rule
Upon task completion, the final response must explicitly summarize:
1. **What was changed** (exactly what features/lines were updated/added).
2. **What files were affected** (list absolute paths or file basenames).
3. **What was NOT changed** (boundaries of the task that were preserved).
4. **Testing Instructions** (any critical steps required to verify the implementation).
